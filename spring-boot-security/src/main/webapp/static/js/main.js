 * 27.1.4 Static Content
 * 
 * By default Spring Boot will serve static content from a directory called
 * /static (or /public or /resources or /META-INF/resources) in the classpath or
 * from the root of the ServletContext. It uses the ResourceHttpRequestHandler
 * from Spring MVC so you can modify that behavior by adding your own
 * WebMvcConfigurerAdapter and overriding the addResourceHandlers method.
